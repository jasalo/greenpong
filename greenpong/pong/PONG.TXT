Pong 1.0 (1999-12-25)

Java Pong.

Tested with:
   AppletViewer for JDK 1.1 (WinNT4 / Win98j)
   Internet Explorer 4 (WinNT4 / Win98j / PowerMac)
   Netscape 4 (Linux / Solaris)

Outline color of paddles, balls and scores will change from black to
green when under coverage of mouse pointer, holding any mouse button
at that time will take control of the object (outline changes from
green to red).  Drag mouse to modify object, release button to return
control to computer.

This was just an exercise in Java applets/threads, and it was far,
*far* easier than Direct3D Immediate Mode ;)

1.01

   On 9/28/01, almost two years later, a bug was found in the packaged
   html file.  Hey, better late than never, right?

   The sources have been cleaned up to fit with 80 column text.  Also,
   by this time, JDK 1.3.1 is released, and the use of Thread.stop has
   been deprecated.  The sources has been updated to not use this
   function.

   This version has been tested with AppletViewer for JDK 1.3.1, and
   IE5 on windows 2000.
